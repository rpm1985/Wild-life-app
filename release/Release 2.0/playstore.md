Wildlife is an app aimed to make identifying local wildlife easier. The app is to be able to record sightings of species on a GPS located map of Cardiff.


# New Features!

  - Creation of Account and logging
  - Identify certain bird species via a series of filters giving a clear image and description as a result
  - Pinpoint exactly where the nearest Nature Reserves are in the local area
  - Observe a list of local Nature Reserves
  - Immersive yourself in wildlife by reading more into the institutions in the local area





You can also:

  - Click on the Nature Reserves within the list to redirect you to the place it is on the map
  - Personalize the application by creating an account
  - Log in via email or with facebook
  - Browse through the application in either English or Welsh

  



> The world is becoming increasingly urbanized and this is leading to an increased lack of interest in wildlife and a reduction in the time people spend outdoors in green spaces.

There are still some major known issues that are in the application that we wish to fix as soon as possible.

### Key Issues

* Welsh language settings don't apply to the species identifier
* Minor bugs when trying to log in with Facebook
* Share feature linked to social media to share the species identified


### Apsirations



In order to fully complete the aim of the product the app will have to include:

* Inclusion of a map function for locating and recording species
* Connectivity with other users
* A search feature for known species without having to use the identification feature every time
* Ability to use sound to help in the identification
* Inclusion of geofencing to get relevant information about the local area
